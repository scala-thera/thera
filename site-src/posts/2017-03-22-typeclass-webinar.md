Hello,

It is my pleasure to invite you to a free webinar of mine where I am going to introduce type classes and some basic usage of them in purely functional libraries.

The webinar will take place on **Sunday, April 2nd, 3 PM UTC**.

The content covered will include:

- An introduction to type classes: what they are and how they are defined.
- An example demonstrating where the type class approach can beat hierarchies in terms of extensibility and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)ness.
- An introduction to [Cats](http://typelevel.org/cats/) - a library containing common type classes. Most probably there will not be enough time to cover individual type classes. So the overall design of the library will be covered instead - this should give you a good starting point for exploring it yourself.
